# Welcome to Lmsflm's GitHub page

I'm a student using this GitHub page mainly for personal and experimental projects, including small-scale ideas and mini-projects. Some repositories may be incomplete, inconsistent, or exploratory, as this space is mainly used for learning and testing.

As of now, I have some little experience with <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76d328ee-63a9-49de-81a5-20e146b9517a" width="18"/> Python, <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e13a759-76ec-468c-931d-1d2669d8b4eb" width="18" /> C++, <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1693460-b1c7-4b23-a5fb-53a00ecba405" width="18"/> JavaScript, and <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d87848-cf7f-4f12-8ed1-94ee3a5c6ce8" width="18"/> Kotlin.
