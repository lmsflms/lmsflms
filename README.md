# Welcome to Lmsflm's GitHub page

I'm a student using this GitHub page mainly for personal and experimental projects, including small-scale ideas and mini-projects. Some repositories may be incomplete, inconsistent, or exploratory, as this space is mainly used for learning and testing.

As of now, I have some little experience with <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d912db34-9020-4193-8ab9-ceb83c733699" width="20" align="center"/> Python, <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21992fc9-c367-49d6-8d00-1393d3a3334a" width="20" align="center"/> C++, <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/814ea29e-8206-4867-a0f9-5d82de4755ca" width="20" align="center"/> JavaScript, and <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b045c6cf-afec-47ae-9095-267ad952da98" width="20" align="center"/> Kotlin.
